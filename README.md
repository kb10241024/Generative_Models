Repository for different genrative models such as Variational AutoEncoders and most popular GANs.

## What are GANs?
[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A *generator* ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a *discriminator* ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes.

During training, the *generator* progressively becomes better at creating images that look real, while the *discriminator* becomes better at telling them apart. The process reaches equilibrium when the *discriminator* can no longer distinguish real images from fakes.

This notebook demonstrates this process on the MNIST dataset. The following animation shows a series of images produced by the *generator* as it was trained for 50 epochs. The images begin as random noise, and increasingly resemble hand written digits over time.
